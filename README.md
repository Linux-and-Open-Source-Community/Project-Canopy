Project-Canopy-V2
==============================

The Congo Basin is home to the world’s second-largest tropical rainforest, spanning 2.5 million square kilometers over six countries. It is also the world’s last tropical carbon sink and the home of over 1,000 threatened species. This project aims to address deforestation, biodiversity loss, and carbon emissions in the Congo Basin rainforest by providing actionable insights to local communities, civil society, and decision-makers.
