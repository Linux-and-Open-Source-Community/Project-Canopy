## Data Labelling Strategy

### Introduction

This outlines the data labeling strategy for the CanopyWatch project. Ground truth data, consisting of verified instances of deforestation, plays a pivotal role in model training and validation. This strategy details the methodologies and procedures for collecting and utilizing ground truth data effectively.

### Importance of Ground Truth Data

Ground truth data is the foundation upon which accurate and reliable machine learning models are built. In the context of CanopyWatch, it serves several crucial purposes:

1. **Training Models:** Ground truth data provides labeled examples of deforestation, enabling machine learning models to learn patterns and features associated with different types of deforestation activities.

2. **Validation:** It serves as a reference for evaluating model performance. Model predictions can be compared against ground truth data to assess accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

3. **Benchmarking:** Ground truth data allows us to benchmark model improvements by comparing new models against the performance of existing models.

### Data Collection for Ground Truth

**1. Manual Annotation**

Manual annotation involves human experts visually inspecting high-resolution satellite imagery to identify instances of deforestation. This process can be time-consuming but results in highly accurate labels. Key considerations include:

- **Expert Annotators:** Employ experts with domain knowledge in remote sensing and deforestation to ensure accurate annotations.

- **High-Resolution Imagery:** Utilize high-resolution imagery (e.g., Sentinel-2, WorldView) for detailed analysis.

- **Labeling Tools:** Use specialized labeling tools that facilitate the precise marking of deforestation areas.

**2. Crowdsourcing**

Crowdsourcing can be a cost-effective approach for large-scale ground truth data collection. However, it requires stringent quality control measures to maintain accuracy. Considerations include:

- **Data Quality Control:** Implement a rigorous data validation process to filter out erroneous or inaccurate annotations.

- **Annotation Guidelines:** Develop clear annotation guidelines and provide annotators with examples of different deforestation types.

- **Iterative Review:** Implement an iterative review process where annotations are reviewed and corrected by experts.

### Data Splitting for Model Training and Validation

For effective model training and validation, it's essential to split the ground truth data into appropriate subsets:

1. **Training Data:** This subset, typically comprising 70-80% of the ground truth data, is used for training machine learning models. It should cover a diverse range of deforestation types and scenarios.

2. **Validation Data:** A smaller portion (10-15%) of the data is reserved for model validation. It is used to tune hyperparameters, evaluate model performance, and prevent overfitting.

3. **Test Data:** The remaining data (10-15%) serves as a holdout test set to assess the model's generalization performance on unseen data.

### Data Augmentation

To enrich the training dataset and improve model robustness, consider data augmentation techniques, especially when ground truth data is limited. Data augmentation may involve:

- **Rotations:** Creating variations of the same image by rotating it at different angles.

- **Flipping:** Generating mirror images by flipping horizontally or vertically.

- **Brightness and Contrast Adjustments:** Introducing variability in image brightness and contrast.

- **Geometric Transformations:** Applying geometric transformations like scaling and cropping.

### Data Versioning and Documentation

Maintain a robust system for versioning ground truth data, including metadata that records the date of collection, annotator information, and any relevant notes. Document the data collection and labeling process thoroughly, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.

Radiometric calibration is applied to standardize radiometric values across different images. This step is fundamental for quantifying reflectance accurately. Corrections are also applied to rectify sensor-specific variations and atmospheric influences.

#### 3. Atmospheric Correction

Atmospheric effects can obscure the true characteristics of the Earth's surface in satellite imagery. Atmospheric correction methods are instrumental in removing these effects, thereby improving data quality and analysis outcomes.

#### 4. Cloud and Shadow Removal

Clouds and shadows in satellite imagery can impede the analysis of the target area. Robust preprocessing includes the detection and removal of clouds and shadows to ensure clear and consistent input data for ML models.

#### 5. Image Enhancement

Enhancement techniques, such as histogram equalization and contrast stretching, are applied to improve the visual quality of satellite images. Enhanced imagery aids analysts in data interpretation and validation.

#### 6. Data Fusion

In cases where multiple sensors or modalities are employed, data fusion techniques are employed to combine complementary information. This fusion enhances the richness of the input data and can lead to improved analysis results.

#### 7. Data Format Standardization

Preprocessed data is converted into standardized formats, such as GeoTIFF or HDF5, to ensure compatibility with ML frameworks and tools. This standardization streamlines data handling and integration.

### Documentation and Version Control

Transparent documentation of preprocessing steps, parameters, and software tools used is paramount. Additionally, version control mechanisms should be implemented for preprocessing scripts and configurations. Documentation and version control enhance reproducibility, facilitate error tracking, and support collaboration within the project team.
